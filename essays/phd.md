### 

When I think about pursuing an Ph.D., I know it's hard. I know it's even lone, stressful and devastated. I know it's a lifetime story. 
But I love stories.
And I am so passonate about telling good stories.
Good story is a journey itself.

And you know, the best journeys answer questions that in the beginning, you didn't even think to ask.

I've been always wondering why men so fastasinated about being the best. I truly do. I'm sorry if you're not strive to be the number one, but almost all of male students I met, they want to be the first of the class.

I solely want to be fresh. Be meaningful. I'm obssesed how could I help others, not only my family, my friends. But others.
I believe in the fact that life should be better, not longer.
Do small thing with big heart
